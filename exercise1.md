Assumption: A team of 06 people working on a project which is developing using Python

Common CI/CD Steps to follow : 
    * Linting
        - Pylint, Flake8, pycodestyle
    * Testing
        - There are a few areas that need to be considered when it comes to testing
            1. Unit Testing
                - unittest, pytest, nose
            2. Integration Testing
                - mock, request-mock
            3. Functional Testing
                - Selenium, Appium, Behave
            4. End-to-End Testing
                - Cypress, Playwright
            5. Additional Testing
                - Coverage.py, Hypothesis, Doctest
    * Building
        - There are areas that need to be considered when it comes to using build tools also
            1. Packaging Tools
                - setuptools, fit, poetry
            2. Build Automation Tools
                - tox, buildout, wheel

Obviously, for CI we can use both GitHub Actions and Jenkins, but the following are a few of the alternative options that can be considered
    * Cloud-Based CI/CD Platforms
        1. CircleCI
        2. Travis CI
        3. GitLab CI/CD
        4. Bitrise
        5. Semaphore CI
    * Self-Hosted CI Servers
        1. Buildbot
        2. Drone.io
        3. GoCD

When it comes to deciding which set-up is best for this team, We need to think about a few things mostly related to the project and the team. 
 1. Budget - How much can allocate and invest in the tools and infrastructure? 
 2. Skills and experiences - What is the level of experience and expertise the team has? 
 3. Security - How sensitive the project data is?
 4. Scalability and Growth - How many builds do they expect to run daily or weekly? Will this project scale significantly in the future?

 Based on the the answers we can come up with for the above questions we can get a clear idea of what kind of configuration will meet the requirements. But before coming to any conclusion need to consider Integration with Version Control, Integrations with Other Tools and Community Support additionally when it comes to practicality. 

 Ultimately, the best choice depends on the specific needs and priorities of the project and the Team. Evaluating the factors mentioned above and the project's context will guide toward the optimal solution for this CI setup
